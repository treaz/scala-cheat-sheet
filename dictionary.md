# A dictionary of terms that are associated with scala

* infix notation: the syntactic sugar which allows invoking an object method without using ".". E.g. "hi".toString -> "hi" toString
* method reference syntax: in a lambda expression, you can autoconnect the arg to the method call E.g. list.foreach(println)
* type aliases:  
* function with named arguments: enable you to specify an argument for a particular parameter by associating the argument with the parameter's name rather than with the parameter's position in the parameter list
* function with default values:  allows specification of a default value for a function's argument
* primary constructor
* idempotent function: results remain unchanged when the function is applied more than once. E.g. toUpperCase
* pure function
* companion object: an object that accompanies the class with the same name. The static fields are always separated from the non-static by using this pattern.
* "apply" method 
* Linearization: the process of solving duplicate methods in traits (goes right to left)
* expression: returns a value
* statement: carries out an action 
* for comprehension
* case classes
* type aliases/aliasing imports
* native xml support
* either/try
* tail recursion
* implicits
* ranges
